# Project RunningDogs (American Football game!)

To get this up and running you need to clone to repository as standard

```bash
git clone https://github.com/royletron/runningdogs
```

Then download and fire up Unity, make sure it is 5.3.4 or higher. Once in Unity on the ‘Projects’ screen click ‘Open’ and point it to the cloned directory. It should hopefully then pick everything up.

### What Am I Looking At...

Ok so once you are in Unity and the project is successfully in front of you, you should see a basic formation layed out. You can go ahead and click the play icon to see this run. When running you can toggle the various buttons at the bottom of the screen, which ‘Play’ (as in start the simulation), ‘Create Runs’ (which you can then drag from the various players), ‘Move Players’ (which is a bit funky as the colliders are all still turned on, will fix this at a later date) and finally ‘Reset’ which will put everything back to the start (hopefully).
